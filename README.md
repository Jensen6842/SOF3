# Software 3: Functional Programming with Applications

## Description
This module teaches the basics and some advanced features of typed, lazy functional programming; illustrated with a variety of applications including implementing Domain Specific Languages by both deep & shallow embedding. <br />
Covers a range of functional-programming techniques, type classes, and testing tools.

## Blocks
### Block 1
This block focuses on the introduction to Functional Programming and Haskell: Declarative vs Imperative. <br />
The block will also introduce Recursion, Functions and Type Systems in Haskell.

### Block 2
This block focuses on Lists, Laziness and Lambda Calculus. <br />
The block will also extend on Types, Recursion and Functions in Haskell.

### Block 3
This block focuses on Reasoning and Type Classes. <br />
The block also has extended material on Recursion.

### Block 4
This block focuses on Effects and Programming with Monads.

### Block 5
This block focuses on some advanced topics such as strictness, exceptions and property-based testing via QuickCheck.
